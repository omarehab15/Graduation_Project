# 🚗 Autonomous Automotive Parking System

### Graduation Project – Mechatronics Engineering – 2024

## 📌 Overview

This project presents the design and development of an **autonomous self-parking system** capable of detecting suitable parking spaces, selecting the appropriate parking type (parallel or perpendicular), and executing the parking and exit maneuvers automatically. It integrates **Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)** concepts to enhance safety, reduce human error, and improve parking efficiency in tight urban environments.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Design and implement a self-parking car prototype.
* Detect available parking slots using ultrasonic sensors.
* Identify and differentiate between **parallel** and **perpendicular** parking.
* Plan and execute the **shortest collision-free path** to park the car autonomously.
* Test the system under real-world conditions.

## 🧠 Features

* Automatic detection of parking spaces.
* Smart decision-making for choosing parking strategy.
* Smooth and safe maneuvering using **non-holonomic kinematic constraints**.
* Real-time obstacle detection and avoidance.
* Full software architecture including **MCAL**, **HAL**, and **Application Layer**.
* Real-time scheduling using **RTOS**.
* MATLAB-based simulation and validation.

## 🧭 Path Planning Strategy

Implemented two main algorithms:

* **Parallel Parking**: CSC (Circle-Straight-Circle) path planning
* **Perpendicular Parking**: CS (Circle-Straight) path planning

Each parking scenario includes:

* Obstacle detection
* Space validation
* Shortest path generation
* Collision avoidance verification

## 🧪 Testing & Results

* Simulations verified using MATLAB for both parking types.
* Real-world tests showed **accurate space detection** and **successful autonomous parking** in predefined spaces.
* Limitations like tight turning radius or dynamic obstacles noted as future development targets.
